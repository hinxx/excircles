This sample will initialize the ILI9325D 240x320 display in 8-bit mode and
display some colors.

The pinout is as follows:

nRD		+3.3V
nWR		GPIO1
nCS		GPIO22
RST		GPIO23
RS		GPIO5
DB8		GPIO21
DB9		GPIO20
DB10	GPIO26
DB11	GPIO16
DB12	GPIO19
DB13	GPIO13
DB14	GPIO12
DB15	GPIO6

The sample was tested against ITDB02-2.4E GLCD + touchscreen module.

UTFT Arduino Library was used for reference
