README

This sample will obtain pressure and location of a single touch from the
TSC2046 (or pin compatible XPT2046) IC. Data bytes are transferred via the
SPI interface at a maximum IC speed. Finger presence and its coordinates
(X, Y) are reported by the event handler.

NOTE: At the moment the X/Y values are not normalized to display size.

SPI0 master is used.

The pinout is as follows:

SCLK	GPIO11
MOSI	GPIO10
MISO	GPIO9
CE0		GPIO8
IRQ		GPIO25 (unused)

The sample was tested against ITDB02-2.4E GLCD + touchscreen module.

XPT2046 Touchscreen Arduino Library was used for reference
(https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/XPT2046_Touchscreen).
