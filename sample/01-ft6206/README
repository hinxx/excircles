README

This sample will obtain pressure and location of the touch from a FT6206 IC.
It was tested with Adafruit PiTFT 2.8" module using CST026-A IC (clone of FT6206?).
Data bytes are transferred via the I2C. Received touch coordinates (X, Y) are dumped
to serial console. The values are normalized to display size of 320 x 240 pixels.

I2C master is used.

The pinout is as follows:

SDA	GPIO02
SCL	GPIO03
IRQ	GPIO25 (unused)

FT6206 Touchscreen Arduino Library was used for reference
(https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_FT6206_Library).
