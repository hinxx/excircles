This sample will allow user to draw on the PiTFT module.

It is best to use the default coefficients for translation since the LCD and
touchscreen both span 240 x 320 pixels. The rotation of 180 degrees needs to
be applied to the touchscreen coordinates to make them coincide with the LCD.

Tested with PiTFT 2.8" LCD module.
