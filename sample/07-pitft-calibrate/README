This sample will allow user to calibrate touchscreen on the PiTFT 2.8 module.

It turns out that the calibration of the touchscreen results in inaccurate
coordinates being calculated. As a result the area of the complete LCD is
not being utilized.

It is best to use the default coefficients for translation since the LCD and
touchscreen both span 240 x 320 pixels. The rotation of 180 degrees needs to
be applied to the touchscreen coordinates to make them coincide with the LCD.

Tested with the capacitive PiTFT 2.8" LCD module.
