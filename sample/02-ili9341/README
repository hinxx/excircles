This sample will initialize the ILI9341 240x320 display in 4 wire SPI mode
and display some colors.

SPI0 master is used.

The pinout is as follows:

D/CX	GPIO25
CSX		CE0# / GPIO8
SDI		MOSI / GPIO10
SDO		MISO / GPIO9
SCL		SCLK / GPIO11

The sample was tested against PiTFT 2.8" GLCD + touchscreen module.

UTFT Arduino Library was used for reference
(http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51).
