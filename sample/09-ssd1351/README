This sample will initialize the SSD1351 128x128 display in 4 wire SPI mode
and display some colors.

SPI0 master is used.

The pinout is as follows:

D/C		GPIO24
RES		GPIO25
CSX		CE0# / GPIO8
SDI		MOSI / GPIO10
SCL		SCLK / GPIO11

The sample was tested against Newheaven display NHD-1.5-128128ASC3 1.5"
OLED LCD module.

NHD-1.5-128128ASC3 Arduino Example Code was used for reference
(https://github.com/NewhavenDisplay/NHD-1.5-128128ASC3_Example).
